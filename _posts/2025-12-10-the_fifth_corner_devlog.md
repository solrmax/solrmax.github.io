## Welcome to my Devlog!

Over the past 10 years I've been doing a lot on C# software development, game development and game design. From having my own game company to working as a developer for both local and international companies, from small 5-person indie teams to big corporation teams, from itch.io game jam to multi-platform game releases. From F2P to amazing narrative stories. I have not done it all, yet, but I sure have done a lot and I hope to keep doing even more.

This devlog will focus on the technical side of things, mostly code related topics to be honest, and will evolve according to my wimps and current challenges. I have a small list of topics I want to tackle first, based on my most recent experiences, but after that I will post as I learn new things or fall in love with new systems. Please subscribe if you want to know when every post come, but don't expect a schedule, although having a post a month sounds like a good goal to aim for this 2026.

You can also expect some oddball post from time to time, from simple thoughts on the current industry, ideas, dreams and more. This is my personal devlog after all and I want to share with all of you the things that make my brain click and my heart race. It's been a long time coming I wanted to do something like this, and after building this site I finally have a place for it. Nothing is more exiting than a blank page to start creating.

You are welcome to leave comments and share! Give ideas or feedback!

Lets meet again in the fifth corner of our mind.

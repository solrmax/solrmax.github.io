## Welcome to my Devlog!

Over the past 10 years I've spent a lot of time on **C# software development, game development, and game design**. From having my own game company to working as a developer for both local and international studios, from small 5-person indie teams to big corporate teams, from itch.io game jams to multi-platform releases, and from F2P titles to amazing narrative stories. I haven't done it all yet, but I have definitely done a lot, and I hope to keep doing even more in the future.

This devlog will focus on the **technical side of things**, mostly **code-related topics** to be honest, and it will evolve according to my whims and current challenges. I have a small list of topics I want to tackle first, based on my most recent experiences, but after that I will post as I learn new things or fall in love with new systems. **Please subscribe** if you want to know when new posts come out, but there won't be a strict schedule... although having one post a month sounds like a good goal to aim for in 2026.

There will also be some **oddball posts** from time to time: simple thoughts on the current industry, ideas, dreams, and more. This is my **personal devlog** after all, and I want to share with all of you the things that make my brain click and my heart race. It has been a long time coming; I have wanted to do something like this for a while, and after building this site I finally have a place for it. **Nothing is more exciting than a blank page to start creating.**

You are welcome to **leave comments and share**! Give ideas or feedback!

Let’s meet again in the *fifth corner* of our minds.
